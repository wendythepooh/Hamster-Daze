	  	<p class="description"> As you slowly creep towards the blurry figure, it starts to move towards you...
IT’S PRECIOUS, THE CAT. She thrusts her paw towards you and flings your hungry body into the air. You conveniently land in the snack bowl on the counter. Before Precious spots you again, you burry yourself in the snacks. Precious loses interest and you hear her leave through the kitty-door.


Now it’s time to make a decision on which snacks to take back to your new cage home.
