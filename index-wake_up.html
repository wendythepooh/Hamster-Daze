	  	<p class="description"> You are peacefully dreaming when you're suddenly startled awake. As you crack open your eyes and look downwards, you see two tiny pink paws. Slowly, after observing your fur-covered body, you start to realize that you've somehow become a hamster?! As crazy as this is, you can't ignore the fact that you're freaking starving and there's no food in the hamster cage you're trapped inside. It's time to make a decision on how you will break out of the cage.
